# fakenews-classification
classification of news articles as "real" or "fake" using machine learning. Loads a labeled dataset of news articles, then preprocesses the data by removing null values, cleaning text, and performing natural language processing methods such as Tokenization. The text data is then converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a Logistic Regression model is trained on the training set. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, with results presented in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
